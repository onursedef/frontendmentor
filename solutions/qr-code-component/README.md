## My process
I tried to make it look like the one that they gave us but i also wanted to use and learn Tailwind CSS, so first i created a card element then place texts and image into it. After that I gave them styles to make it look like the one in the picture. Lastly I added cards background and elements rounded corners and drop shadows.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Tailwind CSS
### What I learned
It was actually quite easy to give elements styles if you use css libraries. So why I used Tailwind CSS instead of the most popular css library Bootstrap. Well, to begin with Tailwind CSS was so much easy to learn than Bootstrap and because its new and almost as popular as Bootstrap I wanted to give it a try.
### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://www.example.com) - It was easy to find examples in Tailwind CSS Docs so I recommend you to check out if you want to try Tailwind CSS.
